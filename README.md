## Overview

The Java project list from Comp Sci Central mentioned a simple banking application, but their version was limited to the console. I wanted to take things a step further and create a very simple UI and implement DB connections. I started this app end of May 2022, right before my Databases 1 course, in an attempt to get a better understanding of databases and how they can be worked with in Java applications.

### The challenge

- Create a mock-up bank app with DB connectivity
  - Create the database
  - Build the UI in JavaFX
  - Use JDBC to connect the UI to the database

## My process

### Built with

- Java 16
- JavaFX
  - FXML
  - CSS


### What I learned

Thanks to the tutorial from WittCode, I was able to learn how to properly connect the database to the app. While WittCode does have a little bit of information regarding JavaFX in his video, my primary source of information on JavaFX came from Bro Code's GUI course. I picked up their tutorial after finishing my Programming 2 course when I noticed that the course material had relied on the deprecated applets library and went looking for the modern replacement. 

### Continued development

- November 6, 2022
At this point, I have finished the initial connections for checking the mobile login table for valid usernames, creating new mobile logins for valid accounts and error handling to allow the program to still run without crashing. Up next is the banking functionality.

I also took some time to update the readme file to provide more information.  

- July 2022
Completed Database course. Used the knowledge from this course to create the database for the app to connect.

- May 2022
Finished Web Programming 1 which gave me a little more practice in CSS. Using this I created the initial UI concept for the Main, Logged In, and Sign Up pages.
